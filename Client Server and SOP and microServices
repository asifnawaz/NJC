Client-Server
------------

What is a Web server in a client server environment?
Web server is used internally and is not exposed to the public, It is used to deliver content to the users and it is mostly served over http protocol.

What is the role of the presentation layer?
The presentation tier is the front-end layer and it is used to make data graphically present to the end user.

They say this architecture is secure, how is it done in your opinion?
Because this user interface is often a graphical one accessible through a web browser or web-based application and which displays content and information useful to an end user.

What is a Database Server in a client server environment?
Database server is the back-end portion of a database application, following the traditional client-server model

What are Super servers in client server environments?
Mostly, A super server is programmed to start other servers as necessary.

Explain 2-Tier and 3-Tier architecture
Tier-2 Is known as application layer and it contains the functional business logic which drives an application’s core capabilities, it’s often written on Java, python, php etc.
Tier 3 is known as Presentation Tier system and consists of the user interface and usually built on web development frameworks, such as CSS or JavaScript, and communicates with other tiers by sending results to the browser and other tiers in the network through API calls.

What is a File server?
A file server does not normally perform computational tasks or run programs on behalf of its client workstations and commonly found in schools and offices, where users use a local area network to connect their client computers.

SOA & MicroServices
------------------
What are the main benefits of SOA?
Flexibility, improves security, enhances scalability, and tailored requirements or needs.

How can you achieve loose coupling in SOA
Using enterprise service bus, Business Process Management and service oriented integration.


Are web services and SOA the same?
Service Oriented Architecture is an architectural concept which focuses on having different services communicating with each other to carry out a bigger job.
Whereas, A web service is a basic building block in a SOA.

What is a reusable service?
Reusable services are designed so that their solution logic is independent of any business process or technology.

What are the disadvantages of SOA?
High Bandwidth Server, extra overload, high cost

What is ESB and where does it fit in?
An enterprise service bus (ESB) implements a communication system between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented architecture (SOA).

In SOA do we need to build a system from scratch?
There are many platforms available so no need to build a system from scratch. E.g. Mulesoft

What is the most important skill needed to adopt SOA? technical or cultural?
Technical

List down the advantages of Microservices Architecture.
Microservices Make On-Boarding Easier
Reduce Risk
Provide Flexible Data Storage
Increase Fault Tolerance and Fault Isolation
Faster project development

What are the best practices to design Microservices?
When you're building a complex system we can use microservices. e.g. netflix, google api services , microsoft api services etc.

How does Microservice Architecture work?
Using API Gateway, Identity providers, messaging formats etc

What are the pros and cons of Microservice Architecture?
pros: INDEPENDENT,TARGETED, FLEXIBLE and ROBUST 
cons: REFACTORING , COMPLEXITY , TESTING and PERFORMANCE 

What is the difference between Monolithic, SOA and Microservices Architecture?
SOA: Services can depend on other services or resources such as a centralized database
Microservices: Designed to be independently deployable ideally with no external dependencies, so that they can be scaled separately
Monolithic is similar to a big container wherein all the software components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged.

What are the challenges you face while working Microservice Architectures?
System overload caching must be done and Security 

What are the characteristics of Microservices?
Autonomous and Specialized

HTTP Fundamentals
-------------------------------
What are the basic Features of HTTP?
There are Three basic features of HTTP:
HTTP is connectionless, media independent and stateless.

What are request methods in HTTP?
The request method indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given Request URI.
Request Methods:
GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE.

What are the differences between GET and POST methods?
Get methods are defined in URL parameters and POST are methods are sent via a form.

What is status code in HTTP?
The Status-Code element in a server response and it is a 3-digit integer.
e.g.
1xx: Informational
2xx: Success
3xx: Redirection
4xx: Client Error
5xx: Server Error

What are the header fields in HTTP?
HTTP header fields provide required information about the request or response.
There are four types of headers:
General, Client Request, Server Response & Entity header.

What is URI?
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource.

What are Idempotent methods and why do we call them?
A request method is considered "idempotent" if the intended effect on the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the same as the effect for a single such request.
+---------+------+------------+
| Method  | Safe | Idempotent |
+---------+------+------------+
| CONNECT | no   | no         |
| DELETE  | no   | yes        |
| GET     | yes  | yes        |
| HEAD    | yes  | yes        |
| OPTIONS | yes  | yes        |
| POST    | no   | no         |
| PUT     | no   | yes        |
| TRACE   | yes  | yes        |
+---------+------+------------+  

Explain HTTP Request & Response Messages
What is Session State in HTTP?
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
HTTP REQUEST: After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message:
* A Status-line
* Zero or more header (General|Response|Entity) fields followed by CRLF
* An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields.
* Optionally a message-body
HTTP SESSION: Web Servers have a short term memory and this short memory is saved into a browser known as HTTP Session.

What is HTTPS?
HTTPS is the secured HTTP protocol required to send and receive information securely over internet.

Introduction to API
---------------------------
Explain REST and RESTFUL?
REST:
1.Rest(Representational State Transfer)is a style of software architecture.
2.The Rest Service is simple to use it HTTP protocol for all opeartions.
3.Its lightweight and faster(it use the.JSON and .XML formats).
RESTFULL:
1.RestFULL(Representational State Transfer)is a style of software architecture.
2.It uses the Complex Mechanisim like SOAP for Communication.
3.WCF service will allows to make calls and exchange the data using SOAP protocol over different protocols (HTTP, TCP, MSMQ etc..).

Mention what are the HTTP methods supported by REST?
* GET is only used to request data from a specified resource. Get requests can be cached and bookmarked. It remains in the browser history and haS length restrictions. GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data.
* POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. POST requests are never cached and bookmarked and do not remain in the browser history.
* PUT replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
* DELETE removes the specified resource.
* OPTIONS is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
* HEAD asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.

Explain the architectural style for creating web API?
REST is one of the most popular architecture to implement Web API.

Explain the RESTFul Web Service?
Restful Web Service is a lightweight, maintainable, and scalable service that is built on the REST architecture.

Explain what is a “Resource” in REST?
Resource in REST is a similar Object in Object Oriented Programming or is like an Entity in a Database.

Which protocol is used by RESTful web services?
HTTP Protocol.

What is messaging in RESTful web services?
A client sends a message in form of a HTTP Request and the server responds in the form of an HTTP Response. This technique is termed as Messaging.

State the core components of an HTTP Request?
methods like GET, PUT, POST, etc.

State the core components of an HTTP response?
This contains various codes which determine the status of the server response.

What do you understand about payload in RESTFul web service?
Typically the term payload refers to JSON -formatted text that is either posted via an http request.

Explain the caching mechanism?
The caching principle is very general but it is best known for its use in speeding up the CPU or to reduce the server load.

List the main differences between SOAP and REST?
SOAP needs more bandwidth for its usage whereas REST doesn’t need much bandwidth. 
SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST work with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON.

Enlist advantages and disadvantages of ‘Statelessness’.
Pros: 
A stateless system is one that has no resident memory used to store information between sessions.
They do not keep and store information about users or user activity after a user has left a site.
The maintaining parties don't have the responsibility of managing the resident memory.
Stateless applications can be less costly than a similar stateful application. 
Less complex
Cons:
Stateful systems, on the other hand, will put input into resident memory and store it for future operations.
Stateful applications can be more costly than a similar stateless application. 
Stateless will not keep information about a particular user session.
Stateless systems are inherently less capable.
It may be annoying to users to not have certain session information stored.
