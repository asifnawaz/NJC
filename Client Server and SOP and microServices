Client-Server
------------

What is a Web server in a client server environment?
Web server is used internally and is not exposed to the public, It is used to deliver content to the users and it is mostly served over http protocol.

What is the role of the presentation layer?
The presentation tier is the front-end layer and it is used to make data graphically present to the end user.

They say this architecture is secure, how is it done in your opinion?
Because this user interface is often a graphical one accessible through a web browser or web-based application and which displays content and information useful to an end user.

What is a Database Server in a client server environment?
Database server is the back-end portion of a database application, following the traditional client-server model

What are Super servers in client server environments?
Mostly, A super server is programmed to start other servers as necessary.

Explain 2-Tier and 3-Tier architecture
Tier-2 Is known as application layer and it contains the functional business logic which drives an application’s core capabilities, it’s often written on Java, python, php etc.
Tier 3 is known as Presentation Tier system and consists of the user interface and usually built on web development frameworks, such as CSS or JavaScript, and communicates with other tiers by sending results to the browser and other tiers in the network through API calls.

What is a File server?
A file server does not normally perform computational tasks or run programs on behalf of its client workstations and commonly found in schools and offices, where users use a local area network to connect their client computers.

SOA & MicroServices
------------------
What are the main benefits of SOA?
Flexibility, improves security, enhances scalability, and tailored requirements or needs.

How can you achieve loose coupling in SOA
Using enterprise service bus, Business Process Management and service oriented integration.


Are web services and SOA the same?
Service Oriented Architecture is an architectural concept which focuses on having different services communicating with each other to carry out a bigger job.
Whereas, A web service is a basic building block in a SOA.

What is a reusable service?
Reusable services are designed so that their solution logic is independent of any business process or technology.

What are the disadvantages of SOA?
High Bandwidth Server, extra overload, high cost

What is ESB and where does it fit in?
An enterprise service bus (ESB) implements a communication system between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented architecture (SOA).

In SOA do we need to build a system from scratch?
There are many platforms available so no need to build a system from scratch. E.g. Mulesoft

What is the most important skill needed to adopt SOA? technical or cultural?
Technical

List down the advantages of Microservices Architecture.
Microservices Make On-Boarding Easier
Reduce Risk
Provide Flexible Data Storage
Increase Fault Tolerance and Fault Isolation
Faster project development

What are the best practices to design Microservices?
When you're building a complex system we can use microservices. e.g. netflix, google api services , microsoft api services etc.

How does Microservice Architecture work?
Using API Gateway, Identity providers, messaging formats etc

What are the pros and cons of Microservice Architecture?
pros: INDEPENDENT,TARGETED, FLEXIBLE and ROBUST 
cons: REFACTORING , COMPLEXITY , TESTING and PERFORMANCE 

What is the difference between Monolithic, SOA and Microservices Architecture?
SOA: Services can depend on other services or resources such as a centralized database
Microservices: Designed to be independently deployable ideally with no external dependencies, so that they can be scaled separately
Monolithic is similar to a big container wherein all the software components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged.

What are the challenges you face while working Microservice Architectures?
System overload caching must be done and Security 

What are the characteristics of Microservices?
Autonomous and Specialized
